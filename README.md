### Power analysis for conversion rates calculator
#### 
##### This is a django-based web-app that calculates how long a company needs to call highly-recommended leads to see an improvement in their conversion rates

##### The app allows the user to define the following:

*-baseline_conversion_rate : the current conversion rate*

*-uplift : the uplift required in the conversion rate*

*-max_number_of_calling_days : the maximum time a company is willing to call recommended leads*

*-calls_per_day : the average number of calls a day*


##### The calculator will then compute how many days are required for the trial to successfully see an uplift at significance levels of 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%  and 99%.
